I picked the yet-to-be-named bike up from Cascade Moto Classics. This is my 5th motorcycle, and my second Triumph.
Home, sweet home. The Tiger home from its first ride.
My last Triumph was a 2009 Thruxton. I loved that bike, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t fit my needs super well. It was a blast to ride, was absolutely gorgoues, sounded mean as hell, and overall was a great bike.</description></item></channel></rss>

Today I brought home a new motorcycle; a {{<newtabref title="2021 Triumph Tiger 900 RALLY Pro" href="https://www.triumphmotorcycles.com/motorcycles/adventure/tiger-900-rally/rally-pro">}}. I picked the yet-to-be-named bike up from {{<newtabref title="Cascade Moto Classics" href="https://www.cascademoto.com/">}}. This is my 5th motorcycle, and my second Triumph.

My last Triumph was a {{<newtabref title="2009 Thruxton" href="https://bikez.com/motorcycles/triumph_thruxton_2009.php">}}. I loved that bike, but it didn't fit my needs super well. It was a blast to ride, was absolutely gorgoues, sounded mean as hell, and overall was a great bike. It's downfall was that it wasn't great for long rides. About an hour in and I would be begging to be anywhere else. Enter in the Tiger.

I've been hemming and hawing for at least the past year, if not longer, about getting another bike. I was pretty certain I wanted another Triumph, and I was also pretty certain I wanted to get an adventure bike (also known as an ADV bike). For those of you that don't know, an ADV bike are similar to dual sport bikes, but a bit more refined to allow for longer tours on-road, as well as tackle gnarlies stuff off-road. The Tiger fit this bill perfectly.

The Tiger is a 900cc {{<newtabref title="inline triple" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_Triple">}}. It puts out around 90 horsepower, which is more than enough to get me out of any trouble I find myself in while off-road, and more than enough to get me into plenty of trouble on-road. In the RALLY Pro trim, the Tiger comes with a plethora of off-road focused ammenedies such as engine bars, a skid plate, fog lights, {{<newtabref title="Showa" href="https://www.showa1.com/en/product/motorcycle/index.html">}} suspension front and rear, and tubeless spoked wheels. It also has led lighting, tire pressure monitors, heated grips and seats, and a quick shift system to make road riding a dream.

All in all I love this bike. I have only logged a handful of miles so far, but the year is young and I have great plans in store for me and this bike! Stay tuned!

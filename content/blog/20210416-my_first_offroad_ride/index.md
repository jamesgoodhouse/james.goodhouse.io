Tonight I went for my first "off-road" adventure. Sure, this wasn't a hardcore affair, and it wasn't exactly entirely intentional either, but the pavement ended and the ride was tricky, so off-road it was!

It started after a long day of work. I rode out torward the Columbia River Gorge via Marine Drive, and then worked my way over to the {{<newtabref title="Historic Columbia River Highway" href="https://www.oregon.gov/odot/regions/pages/historic-columbia-river-highway.aspx">}}. From there I decided to try my luck on {{<newtabref title="Larch Mountain Road" href="https://multco.us/roads/larch-mountain-road">}}, but soon discovered it was "closed 10 miles ahead". On the off chance the sign was lying to me I opted to find out for myself. Ten miles later, some dropping temps flowing through my mesh riding jacket, and a small snow crossing, and yep, it sure was closed. On my way up I noted spur roads that would be fun to checkout, so I decided to turn off on one of these on the way down.

Unbeknownst to me, the spur road I chose turned into gravel several miles in. I was concerned it might deadend into someone's house but I decided to keep riding, as this was a good chance to test out my new bike and to begin to hone my off-pavement riding technique.

opted to go with offroad mode instead of offroad mode pro. not super familiar with what the settings are, and lots of lights on the dash lit up with warnings and acronyms that i probably should have studied up on before heading out.

locking the rear wheel felt mostly okay and somewhat intuitive. i tested grabbing a handful of front break (not knowing if abs was partially on or now) and managed to somewhat lock it — enough that it bit in and dug a little and i quickly realized that's how you dump your bike.

road was pretty much just gravel, but it turned very steep downhill and ocassionally made for some small ruts/washouts. these felt weird/interesting feeling the bike move around—sometimes gravitating toward the inside of the rut/washout, but hard to know if that was the bike pulling that way, or me leading it inadvetratbly while trying to regulate speed, using mostly just rear brake, and maybe not looking far enough down the road (looking at front tire which i struggle with still).

downhill was difficult as i was tending to get going quicker than i wanted. comfy place was <10mph, or even <8mph. pretty slow and could go quicker, but was just trying to feel it out. was going so slow that keeping it in first was actually pulling the bike downhill and fighting against my attempt to brake with the rear brake. eventually i pulled the clutch and road the rear brake most of the way. unsure if this was a good idea or not, but it ended up working out decent.

stayed seated for the majority of the decent but played with standing up toward the bottom which felt natural and intuitive, i'm looking forward to trying this more. realized why people put bar risers on. i think i could benefit from them, but i'd like to stick with how it is for now.

didn't adjust the supsension at all so still setup for street, but also didn't warrant adjustment.

testing out two pieces of new gear. some (insert glove name here) gloves and some new klim switchback cargo pants. first time riding with proper motorcycle gloves or pants in almost 20 years of riding :gulp: :embarassed:. gloves were tight while wearing at home but felt like they'd loosen up. they ended up working mostly pretty well. had some pain on my middle finger knuckle from the tightness/restriction but i think they'll relax some as i wear them since they're leather. klim pants are wonderful with the exception that the boot opening is a bit small and likely won't accomodate most ADV boots. i love the pockets and quick access. biggest grip is that they appear to have made these pants for people without penises and the like, as a seem on the underside really digs in and frog eyes my boys. could deal with it for a couple hour ride, but all day touring/riding i think it'd suck. they're a bit snug, but i also have about 8-9 pounds left to lose so i may keep them and try them again soon, otherwise i'll return them and find something else.

[{"content":"Today I brought home a new motorcycle; a 2021 Triumph Tiger 900 Rally Pro. I picked the yet-to-be-named bike up from Cascade Moto Classics. This is my 5th motorcycle, and my second Triumph.\n  Home, sweet home. The Tiger home from its first ride.\n  My last Triumph was a 2009 Thruxton. I loved that bike, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t fit my needs super well. It was a blast to ride, was absolutely gorgoues, sounded mean as hell, and overall was a great bike. It\u0026rsquo;s downfall was that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t great for long rides. About an hour in and I would be begging to be anywhere else. Enter in the Tiger.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been hemming and hawing for at least the past year, if not longer, about getting another bike. I was pretty certain I wanted another Triumph, and I was also pretty certain I wanted to get an adventure bike (also known as an ADV bike). For those of you that don\u0026rsquo;t know, an ADV bike are similar to dual sport bikes, but a bit more refined to allow for longer tours on-road, as well as tackle gnarlies stuff off-road. The Tiger fit this bill perfectly.\n  Nestled into tight quarters, but it\u0026rsquo;ll work.\n  The Tiger is a 900cc inline triple. It puts out around 90 horsepower, which is more than enough to get me out of any trouble I find myself in while off-road, and more than enough to get me into plenty of trouble on-road. In the Rally Pro trim, the Tiger comes with a plethora of off-road focused ammenedies such as engine bars, a skid plate, fog lights, Showa suspension front and rear, and tubeless spoked wheels. It also has led lighting, tire pressure monitors, heated grips and seats, and a quick shift system to make road riding a dream.\nAll in all I love this bike. I have only logged a handful of miles so far, but the year is young and I have great plans in store for me and this bike! Stay tuned!\n","permalink":"https://james.goodhouse.io/blog/2021/04/08/bringing-home-a-new-triumph/","summary":"Today I brought home a new 2021 Triumph Tiger 900 Rally Pro from Cascade Moto Classics!","title":"Bringing Home a New Triumph"},{"content":" Name Email Message  Submit  ","permalink":"https://james.goodhouse.io/contact/","summary":" Name Email Message  Submit  ","title":"Contact"}]
